# Pygame Collection

This repository is a collection of Python games and interactive applications built using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). Each subdirectory contains a standalone game or project, complete with its own assets, dependencies, and documentation.

## Features

- Multiple independent Pygame projects in a single repository
- Organized directory structure for easy navigation
- Each project includes its own resources (images, fonts, audio, etc.)
- Simple setup and requirements for each project

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Each project contains its own `requirements.txt` file. Install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the project:**
   ```bash
   python <main-script>.py
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) (see each project's `requirements.txt` for details)

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding new Pygame projects, improving existing ones, or suggesting enhancements. Please ensure each new project is placed in its own directory with a clear structure and a `requirements.txt` file.
